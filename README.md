## Introduction

The Sports Facility Booking System is a command-line application designed to manage the booking of sports facilities at a university. It provides a simple and efficient way for students to book facilities, view their booking history, and delete their bookings. The system also supports user authentication, ensuring that only registered students can make bookings.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Students can log in using their roll number and password. New students can be added to the system by an administrator. The system also automatically adds some students when it starts.

- **Booking Facilities**: Students can book a facility for a specific date and timeslot. The system checks for booking conflicts and only allows bookings if the facility is available.

- **Viewing Booking History**: Students can view their past bookings, providing a convenient way to keep track of their activities.

- **Deleting Bookings**: Students can delete their bookings if they no longer need them, freeing up the facility for other students.
